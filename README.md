# PWA Text Editor
 ## Overview
 In this repository I have implemented my knowledge on Progressive Web Application's (PWA) to create a text editor that can be be installed, used offline & that is able to cache and store information in the browser. It is an essential skill to have in the era of modern day technologies due to how it can be used and the optimization that these web app's need in order to be efficient.

 ## Challenges 
One thing that I have learned throughout my coding journey is that there are many ways to implement something. There is not only one way to do something in the world of programming. This is both beneficial but may also be detrimental when building an application. Just as there are many ways to be "right" in programming, there are definitely many ways that a developer may be wrong. Using libraries & frameworks can always be of major assistance if they are used in the right sense. This within itself has pros & cons because a developer can be stuck trying to implement the use of ones library without knowing what other issues can arise when developing. A developer may also be stuck trying to create something from "scratch" in my case just using vanilla java script. It is very much a give and take situation but if executed in the correct manner can build something very unique and dynamic.
